# SAMPLE SIMILARITY AND QC
qc:
  clustered_heatmap: |
    The following heatmap shows a hierarchical clustering of pairwise distances
    between samples. Darker blue means less distant (i.e. more similar). In general
    we expect to see replicates clustering together and separation of treatments.

  pca: |
    Another way of looking at sample clustering is principal components
    analysis (PCA). The x- and y-axes do not have units, rather, they represent
    the dimensions along which the samples vary the most. The amount of
    variance explained by each principal component is indicated in the axes
    label.

# SIZE FACTORS -----------------------------------------------------------------
sizefactors: |
  ## Size factors {.tabset}

  Ideally, all libraries were sequenced to identical depth, in which case all
  size factors would be 1.0. In practice, this is almost never the case due to
  the difficulties of accurately measuring low concentrations of cDNA. DESeq2 uses size
  factor estimates to normalized for sequencing depth across
  libraries. If some libraries are much higher or lower than
  1 then those libraries had dramatically different coverage and we should be
  careful about interpreting results.

  Simply taking the total number of reads has been shown to be too sensitive to
  a small number of highly-expressed genes. DESeq2's size factors are
  calculated according to the median-ratio method (equation 5 of [Anders
  & Huber
  2010](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2010-11-10-r106)).

  These diagnostic plots show the size factors (as a ranked bar plot) and the
  relationship between the size factors and the total read count (as
  a scatterplot). Samples whose total read count differs from size factor may
  indicate that the sample has a small number of highly expressed genes.

# DDS DIAGNOSTICS --------------------------------------------------------------
dds_diagnostics:
  dispersion: |
    See the [dispersion
    estimates](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#dispersion-plot-and-fitting-alternatives)
    section of the DESeq2 vignette for details.

  colData: |
    This table lists the samples included in the dds object.

  outliers: |
    Are there any samples with many outliers? See the [approach to count
    outliers](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#approach-to-count-outliers)
    section of the DESeq2 vignette for details.

  sparsity: |
    This plot can be used to see if the majority of genes with high counts
    are coming from individual (or a small number of) samples.

  design_matrix: |
    This table shows the design matrix of the dds object.


# RESULTS TABLE ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Help for the columns in the results summary table.
results_table: |
  - The **row names** of the table are the long-format human-readable labels of
  each contrast
  - **name** column is the short name used to generate filenames. Upset plots,
    output TSVs and worksheets in the Excel spreadsheet will be labeled with
    this short name.
  - **up** and **down** are the numbers of up- and downregulated genes respectively.
  - **nonzero.vs.total:** the number of genes with nonzero read counts
    and the total number of annotated genes.
  - **alpha:** genes with an adjusted pvalue lower than this are considered
    significantly changed.
  - **lfcThreshold:** by default, the null hypothesis is that the log2 fold
    change of genes is not different from zero. In some circumstances, it is
    useful to use a different threshold, which will be reported here.
  - **outliers:** Cook's distance is used as a measure of how much a single
    sample is influencing the fitted coefficients for a gene. If that value
    is too high, the gene is marked as an outlier and the pvalue and adjusted
    pvalue will be set to NA. If there are many (hundreds to thousands) of
    outliers, this is an indication that a sample may be problematic. In this
    case, the dds diagnostics plots may help identify the culprit.
  - **low.counts:** How many genes were not even tested for differential
    expression because they had too low counts.
  - **dds:** The name of the DESeqDataSet object used for the contrast (see
    "other diagnostics" section above for details).
  - **design:** the design, using R syntax. Originally described by
    [Wilkinson
    1973](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2346786?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents),
    but see the [section in R for Data
    Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-basics.html#formulas-and-model-families)
    as well.
  - **test:** The contrast performed using the design. Words in this column
    indicate the contrast was specified to DESeq2 using a 3-item character
    vector. Numbers (like `0,+1`) indicate a numeric contrast. For more details
    on the design, check the design matrix tab in the diagnostics section for
    the corresponding dds object matching the name in the *dds* column.


# RESULTS PLOTS ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Help for the tabbed results plots
results_plots:
  ma: |
    An **M-A plot** gives a good overview of the comparison. There is one dot per gene.
    It shows three dimensions: the normalized counts (baseMean, on a log10 scale,
    x-axis), the effect size (log2FoldChange, y-axis) and whether or not a gene was
    signficant (color). While it is tempting to interpret baseMean as
    "expression level", this would not be correct because the values are only
    normalized to library size, not transcript length. We can say that a gene
    with higher baseMean than another gene has more observed reads, but we
    cannot say whether that is because it has a longer transcript or because
    there are more transcripts.

  volcano: |
    A **volcano plot** shows fewer dimensions than an M-A plot (it does not show
    normalized counts) but it can be useful for looking at the relationship of
    adjusted p-value and log2FoldChange.

  pval_hist: |
    The **raw p-value distribution** helps us assess if the data met the
    assumptions of DESeq2. This [Variance Explained blog
    post](http://varianceexplained.org/statistics/interpreting-pvalue-histogram/)
    has a good explanation of intepretation. Additionally, we color the p-values
    for genes that have been removed from independent filtering due to having too
    low counts.

    See the DESeq2 vignette on [independent filtering and multiple
    testing](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#independent-filtering-and-multiple-testing)
    for more details.


# RESULTS DIAGNOSTICS ----------------------------------------------------------
# Individual help for the diagnostic plots for results objects
results_diagnostics:
  filter_ma: |
    This MA plot colors genes by whether or not they were filtered out in the
    independent filtering step.</details>

  outlier_ma: |
    This MA plots colors genes by whether or not they were considered an outlier.

  lfcse_basemean: |
    This plots the standard error of the log2FoldChange (lfcSE) vs baseMean. In
    general, as baseMean increases the lfcSE decreases.

  lfcse_lfc: |
    Standard error of the log2FoldChange vs the log2FoldChange itself.


# UPSET PLOTS ------------------------------------------------------------------
upset_plots: |
  # UpSet plots {.tabset}

  Here we gather together all the interesting gene sets into an [UpSet
  plot](http://caleydo.org/tools/upset/). These plots show the combinatorial
  overlaps of genes found to be up or down across the different contrasts
  performed. It's much like a Venn diagram, but easier to interpret and can scale
  to many comparisons.

  The plot shows a summary of which genes were found in common across
  contrasts. If you want to know the details of *which* genes were found in
  common, a TSV file is linked under each plot. This file has rows for each
  gene and columns for each contrast. A `1` indicates that gene was found to be
  up/down/changed in that contrast. You can sort this TSV to identify the genes
  of interest. For example, sorting all columns in descending order will cause
  genes shared in all contrasts (a `1` in each column) to come to the top.

  **Interpretation notes:** A gene can only be found in one column in an UpSet
  plot. So if you want to confirm that the number of genes for a contrast
  matches the results tables and MA plots, sum all the bars for which there is
  a dot in that contrast's row.

results_files:

  The best way to use these is to rank by the log2FoldChange column, and then
  consider genes whos padj value falls below 0.1.

  **A note on NA values:** DESeq2 uses NA to encode extra information about
  a gene, depending on which column the NA is found in.

  - If log2FoldChange, pvalue, and padj all NA it means that the baseMean was
    0. That is, no samples in this contrast had any reads.

  - If only pvalue and padj are NA it means that the gene was detected as
    a count outlier.

  - If only padj is NA, it means the gene had too low counts and was filtered
    out from multiple testing because it had no chance of being significant,
    thereby reducing the harshness of the rest of the multiple testing
    adjustments.

  The output files have the following columns.


  - **gene** is typically the most stable accession. For most organisms, this
    is Ensembl. Human-readable names can be inconsistent (or missing in many
    cases), so these IDs provide the most robust way of ensuring each gene has
    a unique ID.
  - **SYMBOL, ALIAS, UNIPROT, ENTREZID**, and possibly others, are columns with
    additional gene identifiers. Typically SYMBOL and ALIAS will be the most
    human-readable.
  - **baseMean** is the average number of normalized reads across all samples.
    It is used for estimating dispersion and gives an indication of how much
    evidence there is for a gene. It should not be interpreted as expression
    level, since these values are not normalized by transcript length (which
    would introduce various biases).
  - **log2FoldChange** is the effect size of differential expression. DESeq2
    first calculates the simple log2 fold change using the mean of normalized
    counts for the condtions being compared. However, both 1/5 and 1000/5000
    give a fold change of 5x, but the latter has much more information and we
    would want to put more stake in that. So DESeq2 uses log2 fold change
    shrinkage methods to down-weight 1/5 to something smaller than 5x so that
    we don't design follow-up experiments on results with low information. For
    more details, see the papers on
    [apeglm](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty895),
    [ashr](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxw041), and
    [normal](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8). **This is designed to
    be the most important column to sort on.**.
  - **lfcSE** is the standard error of the log2FoldChange estimate. In general,
    the log2 fold change for genes with high lfcSE will be shrunken more. This
    column is sometimes useful for diagnostics but not routinely used.
  - **stat** is the test statistic used for generating the p-value. It can
    sometimes be useful for diagnostics but is not routinely used.
  - **pvalue** is the *raw pvalue*. **Do not interpret these values** because
    they are not adjusted for multiple comparisons. This column is included
    because sometimes it has an NA, which can be informative (see above notes
    on NA values).
  - **padj** is the pvalue, adjusted for multiple tests. This is required to
    weed out bad data that looks good. See this [StatQuest
    video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8LQSvtjcEo) for an explanation.
    **Use this column** to assess statistical significance. It is equivalent to
    the false discovery rate. Unless otherwise noted, use the default of 0.1 as
    the threshold. This means that out of all the genes that have padj values
    less than 0.1, we may be wrong on 10% of those. In other words, 10% of the
    significant genes aren't actually significant.
